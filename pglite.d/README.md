# PGLite Without `pglite`

Every PGLite database directory contains all the scripts necesary for
starting, stopping and configuring the database. To include PGLite in another
project, it's enough to archive `pglite.d` (the directory this README is in).
To create a database in a particular place, there are three steps:

* unpack the archive to that directory,
* set settings with `./settings`,
* run the setup process with `./setup`.

## Setting Settings

Settings are managed with `./settings`, which allows one to set
`postgres.conf` settings, enable or disable random port binding, and add
schema files and data files to the initialization process.

PGLite metadata, like `info/token` and `info/etc/sock`, can be directly
manipulated by writing these files before running `./start` or `./setup`.

## Database Directory Layout

The database directory contains the Postgres data files, a log file, PGLite
metadata and all the database commmands:

```
.../
    db/                                         -- The Postgres database itself
    info/                                          -- Metadata used by `pglite`
    log                                                    -- Postgres log file
    main                            -- Utilities used by control scripts, below
    reset              -- Stop the database server and clear the data directory
    run                          -- Run a command that connects to the database
    sql   -- Connect to the database with `psql`, starting the server if needed
    setup                       -- Change settings or reinitialize the database
    settings           -- Set Postgres settings and add schema and seed scripts
    start                                          -- Start the database server
    stop                                            -- Stop the database server
    status                     -- Status (running? stopped?) of database server
    url                                                  -- Obtain database URL
```

## The `info` Directory

There are three types of data stored in the `info` directory: permanent
settings, ephemeral state, and metadata.

```
.../info/
         etc/                                             -- Permanent settings
             program                         -- Program name, normally `pglite`
             role                       -- Default database role, normally `db`
             sock      -- UNIX socket location, by default generated from token
             pg/                        -- Values to merge with `postgres.conf`
             url/                        -- Database URLs generated by `pglite`
         var/                                -- Temporary, stateful information
             pg/                        -- Values to merge with `postgres.conf`
             url/                        -- Database URLs generated by `pglite`
         t                       -- Creation time, as an ISO 8601 UTC timestamp
         token                                                 -- Database UUID
```
